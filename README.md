This is a mod for the game Haiku, the Robot that adds an on-screen health
bar to every boss fight. For the purpose of this mod, a "boss" is anything
that appears in the Trial of Steel, the game's boss rush mode.

# Configuration

There are two options in the Configuration Editor menu:

- **Show Boss HP Bar**: displays the health bar when fighting a boss.
- **Show Boss HP Numbers**: displays the current and maximum health of the current boss while fighting one, on top of the health bar. This can be used *without* the health bar, in which case only the numbers appear.

## Reskinning the bar

To change the appearance of the health bar, replace the bar.png and
filled_bar.png files that are located in the same directory as this mod's
DLL file; this directory is usually `BepInEx/plugins/BossHPBars` where
you installed BepInEx.
